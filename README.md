Database project

Cimeta: the animal facility of the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”

We want to create a database application for the management of an animal facility and specifically the CIMETA animal facility of the University of Tor Vergata.
CIMETA is the Center for Comparative and Experimental Medicine and has as its objectives: the housing and care of laboratory animals for use in scientific research.
CIMETA is an institute consisting of operating rooms, laboratories, housing rooms, office spaces and a warehouse.
The bodies of CIMETA are the Coordinator and the CTS, or the Technical Scientific Council. The Coordinator of CIMETA is a tenured professor of the University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, elected by the CTS. The Coordinator can nominate a Vice-Coordinator, chosen from among the tenured professors of the University. The CTS is composed of representatives of the Departments interested in the activities of the Center and a veterinarian.
The staff is composed of various professional figures: veterinarians, researchers, technical operators and administrative staff.
The center is mainly attended by researchers from the Policlinico Tor Vergata and the Faculty of Medicine. CIMETA is also a research center for third parties and for national and international research projects.
Animal testing is conducted according to current regulations in compliance with animal welfare and in compliance with the "3Rs": Reduction, Refinement, Replacement.
The animal species hosted at the Rome Tor Vergata animal facility are rats, mice, rabbits and pigs. The choice of species intended for research is determined by genetic proximity to humans. Animals with a rather short life cycle are preferred.
Colonies of normal or "GMO" animals are entrusted to the animal facility staff for ordinary management (changing litter, water, feed, eliminating carcasses, recording deaths); all other activities are the responsibility of the research group or individual researcher. Animals must be treated only in internal laboratories and only by researchers included in the research project.
Objectives of the project:
The aims of the project are aimed at creating a database for the management of the animal facility. Specifically, the management concerns the collection of data regarding the animal species present within the animal facility and the research projects for which they are used. Furthermore, all data regarding the professional figures managing the animal facility and the researchers assigned to a specific research project will be managed within the database. There are many areas within the building and they will be divided according to functionality. The environments are structured to guarantee the health and comfort of the animals and the personnel assigned to the experimentation in accordance with current legislation.
